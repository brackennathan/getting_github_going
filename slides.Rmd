# Getting Introduced to GitHub

- Github is an excellent file-sharing tool

- Github is an extension of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a software package that tracks file changes

- It works in the background of your computer with command line to track changes

- This is great! Unlocks so many resources right at your fingertips

- Thanks to [Grant](https://github.com/grantmcdermott) for his great lectures!

#Git works as a compliment to editors

- I am currently using R and R studio, which can also host HTML, PYTHON, and C++

- (I am a huge fan of R Studio) - You should be too, its a great starting point

- Download R [Here](https://www.r-project.org/)

- Download R Studio [Here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

- RStudio has unique reasons as to why it is great to use with git
  - [More information on RStudio Benefits](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)

#Make a repository and update it

- In RStudio go to **File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git**.

- Paste your copied link into the "Repository URL:" box.

- Choose the folder to store your project in ("Create project as subdirectory of:") and click **Create Project**.
