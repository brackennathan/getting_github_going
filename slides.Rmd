# Let's get into our computers more
---

#Bash? 

- We will be focusing on Bash shell CLI

- Default on Linux and Mac OS

- Uses UNIX philosophy
  - "Do one thing and do it well"
  
- Jacob talk about the different options for windows users. Provide links to downloads.

# Some basic commands to get a feel
##### We will navigate to a folder from our home directory and make a new file

| Function | Windows | Apple | 
|:-------------:|:------:|:-------:|
| Display available Directories | dir | ls | 
| Display name of current directory or change current folder | cd | pwd/cd |
| Create a new folder | md / mkdir | mkdir |
| Create a new file (in current directory) | echo | touch |
| Remove a File | del | rm |
| Remove a Folder | rmdir | rmdir |

# Getting Introduced to GitHub

- Github is an excellent file-sharing tool

- Github is an extension of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a software package that tracks file changes

- It works in the background of your computer with command line to track changes

- This is great! Unlocks so many resources right at your fingertips

- Thanks to [Grant](https://github.com/grantmcdermott) for his great lectures!

#Git works as a compliment to editors

- I am currently using R and R studio, which can also host HTML, PYTHON, and C++

- (I am a huge fan of R Studio) - You should be too, its a great starting point

- Download R [Here](https://www.r-project.org/)

- Download R Studio [Here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

- RStudio has unique reasons as to why it is great to use with git
  - [More information on RStudio Benefits](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)

# Ok Lets collect ourselves

- We need Installed/Completed: 
  - R -> https://www.r-project.org/
  
  - R Studio -> https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/
  
  - Git -> https://git-scm.com/downloads
  
  - A Github account created (Use Your UO ID) -> https://github.com/

# The Basic Git Commands

| Step | Command | Purpose |
|:------|:------:|:------|
| 1. | add | to place our file version in the box |
| 2. | commit | Let Git know we are serious about this version ( a secondary save)
| 3. | pull | Updates our local file with the one hosted on github |
| 4. | push | Update Github file with local "merge" |

# Notes for Windows Users

* Windows plays by its own rules
  + Not based on a Unix derivative like macOS and Linux, which run the popular Bash shell and command     language natively
--

* When we download Git on our Windows OS, we can use the Git Bash Terminal that comes bundled with it...
--

  + But because **Bash is based on Unix** and **Windows OS is not**, some of these commands won't work, thereby preventing us from taking full advantage of the functionality that a Unix Shell offers us

# The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

---
# Breaking Down the WSL

* According to [Microsoft's WSL Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq), The WSL is a feature of Windows 10 that enables you to run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and apps.

--

  + It is for anyone who likes using Bash, common Linux tools, and Linux-first frameworks (Ruby, Python, etc.) but also enjoy using Windows productivity tools

--
  
  + WSL enables you to run Linux in a Bash shell with your choice of distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc). Using Bash, you can run command-line Linux tools and apps

---
# Breaking Down the WSL

* At a more mechanical level, we primarily use the WSL to access our local machine's file system from the Linux Bash shell

  + We can access the contents of our local drives that are "mounted" under the `/mnt` folder.

  + For instance, we can access our `C:\` folder (or "C-Drive") by accessing the `/mnt/c` file directory

---
# Disclaimers

* It's not completely necessary...

--

  + You can use the shell commands for Git in the Git Bash shell that is bundled with your download of Git, *but* you're missing out on the chance to better understand how your machine works and become a more effective data scientist

--

* We aren't installing Linux in its entirety on our Windows systems, the **WSL only allows us to manage files using Bash and use the core Linux commands therein**
  
  + For example, we can't launch applications that have graphical elements from the WSL side of our system â€” like RStudio, for example

--

* Installing the WSL can be a little time-consuming
--
  
  + [Microsoft provides thorough documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) on how to install it on your Windows system, which is great! But when we dig into it we find that we are...

--
  
  + Required to opt-in to the Windows Insider program, and likely update and restart your Windows machine a few times. It took Jacob a few hours to get it all up and running, but it will be different for everyone

---
# But Still Do It

* From Jacob's experience, downloading the WSL has given him a better understanding of how computer file systems work. He also loved the flexibility that he was exposed to via the Unix framework
